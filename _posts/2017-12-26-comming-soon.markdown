Eight weeks from now we will sit on our flight to Sri Lanka on 25th of Februar. The flight goes from Frankfurt (FRA)
to Colombo Bandaranayike (CMB) and will land there on Monday the 26th at 4:35 am local time. We will directly continue to
the highlands, taking the train from Colombo Fort railway station.
